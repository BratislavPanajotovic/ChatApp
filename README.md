# ChatApp

What does it do?

The project is a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate within different chat rooms. Users can select from various chat rooms, send messages, and view messages from other users in the same room. The application provides immediate feedback on message delivery and updates the chat interface in real-time.

What was my role?

I conceptualized, designed, and implemented the Chat project from scratch. This involved creating the HTML structure, styling it using CSS to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, and implementing the dynamic functionality using JavaScript. Additionally, I integrated Firebase Firestore for real-time database management, allowing seamless communication between users across different chat rooms.

Why did I build it?

The primary motivation behind building this Chat application was to create a platform for real-time communication among users interested in various topics, such as programming, general discussions, homework help, etc. I aimed to provide a user-friendly and efficient means of communication that enables users to connect, interact, and exchange information in a hassle-free manner. Moreover, the project served as a practical application of my web development skills and allowed me to gain experience in working with real-time databases and event-driven programming.

Technology Stack:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page and organizing content.
CSS: Applied for styling and creating an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
JavaScript: Implemented the dynamic functionality of the Chat application, including user interaction, message sending, and real-time updates.
Firebase Firestore: Integrated for real-time database management, facilitating instant message delivery and synchronization across multiple users and chat rooms.
